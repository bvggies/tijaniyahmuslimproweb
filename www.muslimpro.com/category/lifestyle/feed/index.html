										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The arrival of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, is quiet.</p>



<p>No countdowns. No fireworks. Just a new beginning — simple, sacred and full of unseen potential.</p>



<p>Many people let this moment pass without notice. But for those paying attention, the start of the <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/understanding-muharram-the-islamic-new-year/">Islamic New Year</a> is a gift. It invites us to start over with intention, not pressure. With presence, not perfection. It’s a time to realign with what truly matters.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Setting-Spiritual-Goals-in-Muharram-That-Actually-Stick-Web-1024x576.jpg" alt="Setting Spiritual Goals in Muharram That Actually Stick Web Setting Spiritual Goals in Muharram That Stick" class="wp-image-32308" title="Setting Spiritual Goals in Muharram That Stick 1" srcset="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Setting-Spiritual-Goals-in-Muharram-That-Actually-Stick-Web-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Setting-Spiritual-Goals-in-Muharram-That-Actually-Stick-Web-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Setting-Spiritual-Goals-in-Muharram-That-Actually-Stick-Web-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Setting-Spiritual-Goals-in-Muharram-That-Actually-Stick-Web-18x10.jpg 18w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Setting-Spiritual-Goals-in-Muharram-That-Actually-Stick-Web-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Setting-Spiritual-Goals-in-Muharram-That-Actually-Stick-Web.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ called this month <em>&#8220;the month of Allah&#8221;</em>. No other month in the calendar carries this title, a reminder of Muharram’s spiritual weight.</p>



<p><em>“The best of fasting after Ramadan is in the Month of Allah, al-Muharram.”</em><em><br></em><em> — Sahih Muslim</em></p>



<p>This is the season for inward work. And one of the most powerful ways to honour it is by setting spiritual goals that are not only meaningful, but sustainable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Begin the Islamic New Year With Reflection</strong></h2>



<p>Before setting goals, take a pause. Reflect on the past year. What brought you closer to Allah? What distracted you?</p>



<p>This isn’t about guilt. It’s about reconnecting with your heart. Think of it as a spiritual muhasabah — a personal check-in. Ask yourself gentle, guiding questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What part of my faith do I want to grow in?</li>



<li>Where did I feel most spiritually grounded?</li>



<li>What small practice am I ready to return to?</li>
</ul>



<p>This honest reflection helps ensure your new goals come from sincerity — not comparison or social pressure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choose One Area to Grow (Not All of Them)</strong></h2>



<p>During Muharram, the energy of new beginnings can tempt us to change everything at once. But in Islam, lasting change is rooted in consistency.</p>



<p>Rather than overhauling your routine, choose one spiritual focus for this<a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/what-muharram-2025-means-to-muslims/"> Islamic New Year</a>. It could be:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Memorising a single surah</li>



<li>Praying sunnah prayers consistently</li>



<li>Fasting every Monday (starting with Ashura, the 10th of Muharram)</li>



<li>Spending 5 minutes with the Qur’an daily</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever you choose, start small. The Prophet ﷺ said the most beloved actions to Allah are those done consistently, even if they are few.</p>



<p>If you’re not sure where to begin, explore resources that support gradual growth. For example, <a href="muslimpro://quran-lesson">Quran Lesson Cards</a> inside the Muslim Pro app help you absorb meaning one verse at a time — making Quran study feel accessible and less overwhelming.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Honour the Sacredness of Ashura</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most spiritually significant days in Muharram is the Day of <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/the-day-of-ashura-exploring-the-spectrum-of-events/">Ashura</a> — the 10th of the month. It commemorates the day Allah saved Prophet Musa and his people from Pharaoh’s oppression. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ fasted on this day and encouraged others to do the same.</p>



<p><em>“Fasting the day of Ashura, I hope Allah will expiate for the sins of the previous year.”</em><br>— Sahih Muslim</p>



<p>He also mentioned that if he lived another year, he would fast on the 9th as well. This is why many Muslims fast on the 9th and 10th or the 10th and 11th of Muharram.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/fasting-on-ashura/">Fasting on Ashura</a> is not just about reward — it’s about reconnecting with a legacy of resilience, gratitude, and divine rescue. For those beginning their spiritual journey anew, this fast is a beautiful way to mark the Islamic New Year with sincerity and presence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stay Spiritually Nourished Throughout the Week</strong></h2>



<p>Goals often fade when we feel spiritually disconnected. To stay grounded, build moments of reflection into your weekly rhythm.</p>



<p>You don’t need a full schedule of classes or commitments. Just one piece of meaningful Islamic content each week can keep your heart engaged.</p>



<p>Whether it’s watching a documentary about the Prophets, listening to a reflection on Ashura, or hearing stories from Muslims around the world — choose content that moves you and reminds you why you began.</p>



<p>Platforms like Qalbox on the <a href="https://muslimpro.go.link/e2Gpq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muslim Pro app </a>offer short, insightful videos that complement your spiritual goals and help you stay anchored throughout Muharram and beyond.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://muslimpro.go.link/e2Gpq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="150" src="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/download-muslim-pro-app.png" alt="Text saying ‘Download Muslim Pro App’ with a prompt to install the app" class="wp-image-32338" title="Setting Spiritual Goals in Muharram That Stick 2" srcset="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/download-muslim-pro-app.png 1024w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/download-muslim-pro-app-300x44.png 300w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/download-muslim-pro-app-768x113.png 768w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/download-muslim-pro-app-18x3.png 18w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/download-muslim-pro-app-600x88.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Write It Down, Even If It’s Just a Line</strong></h2>



<p>Intentions are seeds. But without care, they fade. Writing down your spiritual goals — even briefly — helps them stay alive.</p>



<p>Try journaling at the end of each day. Not as a chore, but as a private conversation with yourself and with Allah. Write a short du’a. Note what you struggled with. Celebrate a small success. Keep it real, not perfect.</p>



<p>Tools like the Journal inside Muslim Pro can support this habit. It offers a private space to track your ibadah and reflect on your progress — without pressure or judgment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don’t Wait for Perfection. Begin With Intention.</strong></h2>



<p>You may set a goal and stumble. You might forget to fast on Ashura or miss a day of Qur’an. That’s okay.</p>



<p><strong>Faith isn’t linear. It’s about returning, again and again.</strong></p>



<p><em>“Indeed, those who say, ‘Our Lord is Allah’ and then remain steadfast — the angels will descend upon them&#8230;”</em><br>— Quran 41:30</p>



<p>So as Muharram 2025 begins, start gently. <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/spiritual-goals-in-muharram/">Set one goal</a>. Make one du’a. Fast on Ashura if you can. And most importantly, anchor every step in your intention to grow closer to Allah.</p>



<p>You don’t need to do everything. You just need to begin.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/eid-al-adha-2025-letter-from-muslim-pro-ceo/">Eid al-Adha</a> is more than a celebration. It is a moment of profound remembrance — of a father’s obedience, a son’s surrender and a test that changed the course of human faith. But beyond the rituals of Qurban lies a deeper question: <em>What does </em><a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/qurban-is-a-test-of-sincerity-are-we-passing-it/"><em>sacrifice</em></a><em> actually mean in our everyday lives?</em></p>



<p>We often associate sacrifice with something grand — giving up wealth, comfort, or safety for a greater cause. But for most of us, the real challenge isn’t found in dramatic acts. It’s in the quiet choices we make daily — to hold our tongue, to control our ego, to walk away from sin when no one is watching.</p>



<p>And that’s where restraint becomes ibadah.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Legacy of Sacrifice Begins With Obedience</strong></h2>



<p>When <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/prophet-ibrahims-qurban/">Prophet Ibrahim</a> عليه السلام was shown a vision to sacrifice his son, he didn’t argue. He didn’t delay. He didn’t ask for signs. He obeyed.</p>



<p><em>“So when they had both submitted their wills to Allah, and he laid him down upon his forehead, We called out to him, ‘O Ibrahim! You have fulfilled the vision. Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers’” </em>(Quran 37:103–105)</p>



<p>It was never about the act itself. It was about the willingness to surrender.</p>



<p>That same willingness is asked of us every day. When we’re tempted to respond in anger. When our desires pull us away from our <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/how-to-perform-salah-prayer-for-beginners/">salah</a>. When we’re called to give up comfort for principle.</p>



<p>Real sacrifice today looks like restraint — saying no to the self so you can say yes to Allah.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Restraining the Nafs: A Daily Test</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/From-Sacrifice-to-Self-Discipline-Lessons-in-Restraint-for-Everyday-Life-2-1024x576.png" alt="Dhul Hijjah and the Spirit of Restraint: From Sacrifice to Self-Discipline" class="wp-image-29660" title="Dhul Hijjah and the Spirit of Restraint &amp; Self-Discipline 4" srcset="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/From-Sacrifice-to-Self-Discipline-Lessons-in-Restraint-for-Everyday-Life-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/From-Sacrifice-to-Self-Discipline-Lessons-in-Restraint-for-Everyday-Life-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/From-Sacrifice-to-Self-Discipline-Lessons-in-Restraint-for-Everyday-Life-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/From-Sacrifice-to-Self-Discipline-Lessons-in-Restraint-for-Everyday-Life-2-18x10.png 18w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/From-Sacrifice-to-Self-Discipline-Lessons-in-Restraint-for-Everyday-Life-2-600x338.png 600w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/From-Sacrifice-to-Self-Discipline-Lessons-in-Restraint-for-Everyday-Life-2.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The nafs — our lower self — constantly seeks ease, praise, indulgence, and immediate gratification. It doesn’t like to be challenged. It resists change. But the path to Allah is not paved with comfort. It’s shaped by the moments when we choose Him over ourselves.</p>



<p>We stay up late for work, skip meals to meet deadlines, spend money on things we don’t need — all in the name of success or pleasure. But when it comes to sacrificing sleep for Fajr, or our ego for forgiveness, or luxury for modesty — suddenly, it feels too difficult.</p>



<p>That tension is where the test lies.</p>



<p><em>“Have you seen the one who takes his own desire as his god…?”</em><strong> </strong>(Quran 45:23)</p>



<p>True discipline means putting Allah above our impulses. Restraining the nafs isn’t about deprivation — it’s about elevation. It is choosing Jannah over instant gratification, and that choice, repeated daily, is ibadah.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strength in Restraint</strong></h2>



<p>The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: <em>“The strong is not the one who overcomes others by force, but the one who controls himself in anger.”</em><strong> </strong>(Bukhari)</p>



<p>This hadith redefines strength. It’s not in outbursts or victories — but in quiet control.</p>



<p>When you resist gossip, when you walk away from temptation, when you lower your voice instead of raising it — that is spiritual strength. That is taqwa in action.</p>



<p>Discipline in Islam is not about perfection. It’s about persistence. Trying, failing, and trying again — always with the intention of drawing closer to Allah.</p>



<p>And that trying? That’s ibadah too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practicing Sacrifice in Daily Life</strong></h3>



<p>You don’t need grand gestures to embody the spirit of sacrifice. You need sincerity, intention, and quiet choices made with Allah in mind.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Wake up for Fajr even when your body pleads for more sleep. </strong>That’s your comfort — sacrificed.<br></li>



<li><strong>Lower your gaze when your eyes want to wander. </strong>That’s your desire — restrained.<br></li>



<li><strong>Give in </strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>charity</strong></a><strong> even when your funds feel tight. </strong>That’s your attachment — released.<br></li>



<li><strong>Choose silence when your anger wants to speak. </strong>That’s your pride — softened.</li>
</ul>



<p>These moments may feel small, but they are deeply seen by Allah.</p>



<p><em>“Indeed, those who fear Allah in private — theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.” </em>(Quran 67:12)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building a Lifestyle Rooted in Taqwa</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/a-celebration-of-faith-not-flesh/">Qurban</a> happens once a year. But the opportunity to train the heart in restraint happens every single day.</p>



<p>Start with one change. One habit. One challenge. Maybe it’s fasting once a week. Maybe it’s cutting back on digital distractions. Maybe it’s choosing dhikr over scrolling. The shift doesn’t have to be big — it just has to be intentional.</p>



<p>And over time, that intention becomes rhythm. That rhythm becomes lifestyle. And that lifestyle, when anchored in sincerity, becomes ibadah.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Heart of Qurban Lives in You</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/prophet-ibrahims-qurban/">Sacrifice</a> isn’t always visible. It’s not always about animals, rituals, or grand decisions. Sometimes, it’s in the unseen — the battles within the heart, the quiet choices made when no one’s watching.</p>



<p><em>“Their meat will not reach Allah, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you.”</em> (Quran 22:37)</p>



<p>That is what Qurban was always about. Not the act — but the sincerity behind it.</p>



<p>So as the days pass and the season of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dhul Hijjah</a> fades, let its lessons remain. Let restraint become your daily ibadah. Let discipline be the thread that keeps you tethered to your Rabb. And let every quiet yes to Allah shape the person you are becoming.</p>



<p><em>Continue your sadaqah this </em><a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Dhul Hijjah</em></a><em> — and let your impact multiply. Whether it’s food for the hungry, essentials for children, or aid for those in crisis, every act of giving is a step toward lasting baraqah.</em></p>

<p>You are seen. You are valued. And in the final sermon of the Prophet ﷺ, your dignity was protected in front of the entire ummah.<br><br>The Prophet ﷺ said, <em>&#8220;Treat your </em><a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/the-value-of-women-in-islam/"><em>women</em></a><em> well, for they are your partners and committed helpers.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>These were not just the words of a man. They were the final public words of a Messenger who loved, honoured, and defended women throughout his life. They were spoken on the plains of <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/arafah-dont-miss-this-dua-window-on-the-9th-day-of-dhul-hijjah/">Arafah</a> — witnessed by thousands, preserved for billions.</p>



<p>And they were meant for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>To the one carrying more than she lets on</strong></h2>



<p>You juggle roles, expectations, and responsibilities that often go unseen. You love deeply, give quietly, and sacrifice endlessly. You are the heart of your family, the strength behind your community, and the silent force in your workplace.</p>



<p>But you are not forgotten. The Prophet ﷺ saw you. And he made sure the world would too.</p>



<p>He saw the woman who works tirelessly with little recognition. He saw the mother who gives of herself completely. He saw the daughter whose love softens the hardest of hearts. And he saw the woman who simply tries — every single day — despite the weight she carries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>To the one who feels overlooked or unheard</strong></h2>



<p>You’ve been told to be patient. To be quiet. To be small. But the Prophet ﷺ gave you a voice.</p>



<p>He listened to Umm Salamah when she asked difficult questions. He praised <a href="https://learnislam.sg/who-is-sayidatina-khadijah-r-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khadijah</a> for her strength. He stood when Fatimah entered the room. He cried when he thought of his daughter’s pain.</p>



<p>He didn’t just protect your rights. He honoured your presence.</p>



<p>And when others fail to hear you, remember: the Prophet ﷺ would have.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>To the one questioning her worth in this world</strong></h2>



<p>Know that your worth does not lie in what others see. It lies in the eyes of Allah, who knows your every tear, every struggle, every unspoken prayer.</p>



<p>The Qur&#8217;an declares: <em>&#8220;And women have rights similar to those of men equitably.&#8221;</em> (Quran 2:228)</p>



<p>This means your worth is not a favour, but a Divine truth.</p>



<p>Allah does not forget you. The Prophet ﷺ did not forget you. You must not forget yourself.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>To the one navigating </strong><a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/how-prophet-muhammad-pbuh-honored-women-and-family-2/"><strong>motherhood</strong></a><strong>, marriage, or solitude</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Treat-Your-Women-Well-A-Letter-to-Every-Muslim-Woman-1024x576.png" alt="“Treat Your Women Well” A Letter to Every Muslim Woman" class="wp-image-29649" title="“Treat Your Women Well”: A Letter to Every Muslim Woman 6" srcset="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Treat-Your-Women-Well-A-Letter-to-Every-Muslim-Woman-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Treat-Your-Women-Well-A-Letter-to-Every-Muslim-Woman-300x169.png 300w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Treat-Your-Women-Well-A-Letter-to-Every-Muslim-Woman-768x432.png 768w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Treat-Your-Women-Well-A-Letter-to-Every-Muslim-Woman-18x10.png 18w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Treat-Your-Women-Well-A-Letter-to-Every-Muslim-Woman-600x338.png 600w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Treat-Your-Women-Well-A-Letter-to-Every-Muslim-Woman.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Whether you are nurturing a family, building a career, seeking companionship, or walking alone — you are not lacking.</p>



<p>You are not defined by what you have or don’t have. Your worth is not measured by milestones, titles, or comparison.</p>



<p>You are defined by your sincerity. By your patience. By your acts of service no one else sees. Your role, whatever it may be, holds immense value in the sight of Allah. It is more than enough.</p>



<p>And if you ever feel like you&#8217;re falling short, remember: the most beloved women in Islamic history — <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/finding-maryam-a-s-in-ourselves/">Maryam</a>, Khadijah, Aisha, Fatimah — each had different paths, yet each was honoured uniquely.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>To the one who feels spiritually disconnected</strong></h2>



<p>Maybe you were made to feel like your worship doesn’t count. That your questions don’t matter. That your journey back to Allah is harder.</p>



<p>But He says: <em>&#8220;Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while being a believer — We will surely cause them to live a good life&#8230;&#8221;</em> (Quran 16:97)</p>



<p>He sees your efforts. The late-night prayers in whispered tears. The quiet du&#8217;as while cooking. The Quran you recite between responsibilities. It all counts. It all matters.</p>



<p>The Prophet ﷺ reminded his ummah to treat you with the honour you were created with.</p>



<p>You are not a burden. You are a blessing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>To every woman reading this</strong>,</h2>



<p>You are part of a legacy protected by revelation and defended by the best of men. The Prophet&#8217;s final words weren&#8217;t just legal safeguards — they were love. They were a command to this ummah to never forget who you are.</p>



<p>You were not an afterthought in the Prophet&#8217;s farewell message. Your dignity, your rights, your place in the ummah — all affirmed publicly and unapologetically.</p>



<p>And while the world may forget, dismiss, or overlook you — the Prophet ﷺ did not.</p>



<p>So if the world ever makes you feel small, return to his words. Stand a little taller. Speak a little louder. Love yourself a little deeper. You were mentioned in the Prophet’s parting words.</p>



<p>And that matters.</p>



<p><em>With love, hope and du’a,<br><strong>From your sister in faith</strong></em></p>

<p>When the <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/the-best-of-character/">Prophet Muhammad </a> صلى الله عليه وسلم stood before more than 100,000 people in his Farewell Sermon, he delivered a message that cut through centuries of tribalism, racism, and social hierarchy:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;No Arab has superiority over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab over an Arab; no white over a black, nor black over a white, except by piety and good action.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>It wasn’t just revolutionary for 7th-century Arabia. It is still revolutionary today. In a world where difference is often used as a weapon, the Prophet’s words were a healing balm. Islam doesn’t just tolerate diversity — it honours it. It elevates it. It cherishes it as a sign of Allah’s mercy.</p>



<p>The Qur’an echoes this message with beautiful clarity:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.&#8221;</em> (Quran 49:13)</p>



<p>These aren’t just lofty ideals. They are divine instructions: a reminder that our differences are not faults, but features of a deeply interconnected design.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Living the Principle in Everyday Life</strong></h2>



<p>Despite these clear teachings, many Muslims still find it difficult to extend this honouring of diversity in daily interactions. We may unintentionally hold biases around language, culture, or appearances. We may feel closer to those who look or sound like us, and more hesitant toward those who don’t.</p>



<p>But Islam encourages us to rise above these instincts. The Prophet SAW said: <em>&#8220;Verily, Allah does not look at your appearance or wealth, but rather He looks at your hearts and actions.&#8221;</em> (Muslim)</p>



<p>Every Muslim — regardless of background, accent, or skin colour — stands equally before Allah. And it is taqwa, not tribe or title, that defines our rank.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Prophet’s Example of Embracing Difference</strong></h2>



<p>The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم didn’t just teach inclusion — he practised it. He appointed Bilal ibn Rabah, a man of African descent and former slave, as the first to call the adhan. He honoured Salman al-Farsi, a Persian who endured slavery and years of searching for spiritual truth. When Salman proposed the trench strategy during the Battle of the Trench, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم embraced his idea which was a pivotal moment that helped secure Madinah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also deeply respected Al-Najashi, the Christian king of Abyssinia who gave protection to the early Muslims when they were persecuted in Makkah. Though not Muslim at first, the Prophet SAW described him as a just ruler and prayed for him upon his death.</p>



<p>Each companion came from a different background, but all were valued equally. The Prophet SAW saw beyond their origins. He saw their faith, character, and sincerity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reflection for Today</strong></h2>

<p>We may not control the structures around us, but we can control our adab — our manners, our assumptions, and our way of seeing others.</p>



<p>Do we make room for different cultures in our events and homes? Do we listen to someone who worships differently than we&#8217;re used to? Do we value sincerity over style, taqwa over fluency?</p>



<p>These are quiet ways to honour the diversity Allah created. These are subtle forms of ibadah too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A More Welcoming <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/the-love-prophet-muhammad-pbuh-had-for-his-ummah/">Ummah</a> Starts With Us</strong></h2>



<p>The Prophet’s final message was not just a farewell. It was a legacy. His sermon is a reminder that we each have a role to play in building a welcoming, spiritually rich ummah.</p>



<p>From community gatherings to classroom settings, from how we greet others in the masjid to who we give leadership opportunities to — each choice reflects whether we’re living the Sermon’s message or leaving it behind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More Than Tolerance</strong></h2>



<p>Islam doesn&#8217;t ask us to erase differences. It asks us to see Allah’s design in them. To learn from one another. To strengthen bonds through shared faith, not sameness.</p>



<p>Every time we choose humility over judgement, inclusion over assumption, and sincerity over appearance, we honour the Prophet’s final words.</p>



<p>Let us not just recall the sermon. Let us live it.</p>

<p>When we think of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" data-type="link" data-id="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dhul Hijjah</a> and Eid al-Adha, the image that often comes to mind is that of <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/qurban-2025/">Qurban</a> — the ritual sacrifice that symbolises our submission to Allah and honours the legacy of Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH). While <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/qurban-2025/">Qurban</a> is undoubtedly a central act of devotion in this sacred month, the spiritual opportunities of Dhulhijjah extend far beyond the act of sacrifice alone.</p>



<p>The first ten days of Dhulhijjah are not limited to a single ritual. They are an open invitation from Allah to give more, do more, and reflect more. For those who are unable to perform <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/qurban-2025/">Qurban</a> due to financial, logistical or personal circumstances, these days still offer a wealth of ways to earn immense reward.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Spiritual Weight of Every Deed</strong></h2>



<p>The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:</p>



<p><em>There are no days greater in the sight of Allah and in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so during this time recite a great deal of Tahleel (Laa ilaaha ill-Allah), Takbeer (Allahu Akbar), and Tahmeed (Alhamdulillah).” </em>(Musnad Ahmad)</p>



<p>This hadith is a powerful reminder that during the first ten days of Dhulhijjah, <em>every</em> act matters. It doesn’t have to be grand. It doesn’t have to be public. It just needs to be sincere. The barakah of these days elevates every deed — whether it’s a whispered dhikr or a heartfelt donation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Giving Still Matters — Even Without Qurban</strong></h2>



<p>While <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/qurban-2025/">Qurban</a> holds specific reward and meaning, the spirit of giving is not exclusive to it. <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/the-art-of-giving-zakat-sadaqah-and-muwasaat/">Sadaqah</a> or voluntary <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/giving-charity-5-reasons-islam-encourages-it/">charity</a>, is one of the most beloved acts to Allah. And in these sacred days, its impact is even greater — both spiritually and practically.</p>



<p>Giving during Dhulhijjah is not just about fulfilling an obligation. It is about extending mercy, alleviating hardship and standing in solidarity with those who are struggling. It is a way to honour the essence of Eid al-Adha by embodying the values of sacrifice, compassion, and service.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Real Ways to Give in Dhulhijjah</strong></h2>



<p>You may not be able to offer a Qurban, but here’s what you <em>can</em> do:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Send </strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Food Packs</strong></a><strong> to Gaza</strong></h3>



<p>A basic but vital package containing beans, lentils, peas, and rice can help a family facing daily hunger eat a full, nutritious meal. In a place where 97% of households face food insecurity, your act of giving becomes a vital source of sustenance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Provide </strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Fresh Bread</strong></a><strong> to Gaza</strong></h3>



<p>A 3KG pack of fresh, sealed bread may seem small, but it offers stability in an unstable world. For a displaced family, it’s a taste of normalcy. A sense of routine. A reason to gather.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Clothe a Child</strong></a><strong> in Yemen</strong></h3>



<p>A clothing set that includes a jacket, shoes, socks, and a cap can make all the difference to a child who has endured war, displacement, and poverty. It’s more than protection from the cold—it’s dignity. It’s joy. It’s belonging.</p>

<p>Every time you give, you are doing more than meeting a need — you are sending a message: <em>You are not alone.</em></p>



<p>That message travels across borders, transcends languages, and reaches someone whose heart is heavy. In that moment, your <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/giving-charity-5-reasons-islam-encourages-it/">charity</a> becomes not only a means of physical aid but also a balm for emotional wounds.</p>



<p>And Allah sees it all. The Prophet (PBUH) said: “Charity does not decrease wealth.” (Muslim)</p>



<p>When you give with the intention of pleasing Allah, your reward is preserved. Your sustenance is protected. And your generosity is written in the scales of good deeds, especially in these ten sacred days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let These Ten Days Spark a Lifetime of Giving</strong></h2>



<p>Dhulhijjah is a powerful moment to start giving, but it doesn’t have to end here. Let the barakah and motivation of these ten days ignite a habit that lasts well beyond Eid al-Adha.</p>



<p>Start small. Set a monthly sadaqah amount, no matter how modest. Make it consistent. Consider setting up an automatic donation to causes you care about — so your giving continues even when life gets busy.</p>



<p>Bring your family into the practice. Involve your children in choosing where the <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/giving-charity-5-reasons-islam-encourages-it/">charity</a> goes. Let them experience the joy of helping someone else, and allow it to shape their understanding of compassion and gratitude.</p>



<p>Reflect regularly. Make it a habit to ask yourself, “Who can I help today?” Whether it’s financial, emotional, or practical support — giving becomes a way of life.</p>



<p>If you cannot perform <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/qurban-2025/">Qurban</a> this year, do not let the opportunity of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dhulhijjah</a> pass you by. There are so many ways to give, and each one carries the potential for immense reward. Your intention, your sincerity, and your compassion matter.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dhulhijjah</a>, give what you can. Feed the hungry. Clothe the vulnerable. Share what you have, even if it feels small.</p>



<p>Because Allah sees every intention, especially in the best ten days.</p>



<p>Let your generosity reflect your gratitude. Let your compassion echo beyond borders. Let your giving become your worship.</p>

<p>As Muslims around the world prepare their hearts for Eid al-Adha, the sacred days of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dhul Hijjah</a> quietly unfold — ten days like no other. These are not just dates on the calendar. They are a divine opening. A sacred call to return to Allah through worship, sacrifice, and mercy.</p>



<p>We remember the devotion of Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and his son Ismail — their complete surrender to Allah’s will, their trust, and their love. That same spirit lies at the heart of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" data-type="link" data-id="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dhul Hijjah</a>. Yet while many of us prepare for prayer, celebration, and Qurban, there are millions across the world who prepare simply to survive.</p>



<p>In these ten days, what does your charity truly mean to someone facing war, hunger, or displacement?</p>



<p>More than you may ever realise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Reward of Charity During </strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Dhul Hijjah</strong></a></h2>



<p>Charity is never just about money. It is about offering your compassion, your concern, and your willingness to ease another’s hardship. During the most beloved days to Allah, even the smallest act becomes something extraordinary.</p>



<p>The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:<br><em>“There are no days on which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days.”</em> (Bukhari)</p>



<p>And in the Qur’an, Allah (SWT) reminds us of the immense return of sincere giving:<br><em>“The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains.”</em> (Qur’an, 2:261)</p>



<p>These are not ordinary days. And your charity is not an ordinary gift.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gaza: The Urgent Need for Food and Relief</strong></h2>



<p>The humanitarian crisis in <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/duas-for-palestine-prayers-for-protection-strength-and-hope/">Palestine</a> continues to worsen. As of 2025:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Nearly 1.9 million people (about 85% of Gaza’s population) <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-170-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been displaced</a> due to ongoing conflict.</li>



<li>Nearly all households in Gaza are <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/risk-famine-across-all-gaza-new-report-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiencing inadequate food consumption </a>and that 470,000 people are in catastrophic hunger.</li>
</ul>



<p>In this environment, giving during Dhulhijjah becomes more than charity. It becomes a source of urgent relief and eternal reward.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Your Donation Means in Gaza</strong></h3>



<p>To a family in Gaza, a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">food pack</a> is not just a parcel of grains and legumes. It is a meal they haven&#8217;t had in days. It is dignity served on a plate. A pack filled with lentils, peas, beans, and rice gives a mother the ability to nourish her children — perhaps for the first time in a while — without fear, without shame.</p>



<p>And then there is bread. Fresh, warm, familiar. A <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3KG pack of freshly baked bread</a> might seem simple to us, but for a displaced family, it is a return to comfort. It brings back a sense of home. It tells them that even in devastation, someone has not forgotten them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Yemen: Clothing a Child with Dignity</strong></h2>

<p>The crisis in Yemen remains one of the world’s most severe humanitarian emergencies. Over <a href="https://yemen.un.org/en/287505-yemen-humanitarian-needs-and-response-plan-2025-january-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19.5 million people</a>, including<a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/165851/file/2025-HAC-Yemen.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 9.8 million children</a>, require humanitarian assistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a landscape marked by suffering, your charity becomes a moment of joy.</p>



<p>A jacket. A pair of shoes. A cap. Socks. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A complete outfit</a>. To a child in Yemen, this is not just clothing — it’s a reminder that they are not invisible. That Eid is still for them. That someone, somewhere, believes they deserve to be clean, clothed and celebrated.</p>



<p>Your donation gives a child the confidence to walk to Eid prayer in dignity. To smile without hiding. To feel, if only for a day, like every other child in the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Give in the Days Allah Loves Most</strong></h2>



<p>The first ten days of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dhul Hijjah</a> are unmatched in reward, and unmatched in opportunity. Giving in these days is more than generosity — it is an act of worship. A reflection of the very spirit of Eid al-Adha: sacrifice, compassion, and submission to Allah.</p>



<p>Whether you choose to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feed a family</a> in Gaza<br></li>



<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Send fresh bread</a> to ease daily hunger in Gaza<br></li>



<li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clothe a child</a> in Yemen for Eid</li>
</ul>



<p>Know this: you are not simply sending aid. You are being the answer to someone’s du’a. You are placing your trust and your action into the hands of the One who multiplies all good.</p>



<p>Let your charity during Dhulhijjah be the reason someone feels seen. Let your giving be a reflection of your faith.</p>



<p><strong>Give with sincerity. Give in the days Allah loves most. Give before the gates of mercy close.</strong></p>



<p>In these best ten days of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eidadhaArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dhul Hijjah</a>, be the mercy someone is praying for.</p>

<p>Beyond the visible act, <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> is a powerful test and teacher of our deepest intentions. Learn why sincerity (<em>Ikhlas</em>)&nbsp; is key to an accepted sacrifice this Eid. Perform your heartfelt <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> with confidence. Book yours with Muslim Pro today.<br><br>Eid al-Adha arrives each year, bringing with it a flurry of joyous gatherings, preparations, and the well-known act of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a>. It&#8217;s a time steeped in tradition and communal spirit. But as we engage in the outward forms of this blessed occasion, Islam constantly reminds us that the true value of our deeds lies not merely in their appearance, but in their essence, their inner dimension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This brings us to the vital concept of Ikhlas. Ikhlas is the purification of intention, performing actions solely for the pleasure of Allah SWT, seeking no praise, recognition, or worldly gain from anyone other than Him. It is, in essence, the soul of all worship.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>‘Verily, Allah does not look at your appearance or wealth, but rather He looks at your hearts and actions.’</em> (Imam Muslim)</p>



<p>How then does the specific act of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a>, with its rich history and practice, serve as such a powerful teacher and test of this vital spiritual quality, Ikhlas?&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does performing the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> sacrifice help us cultivate deeper sincerity within our hearts?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s explore the profound lessons of sincerity embedded in the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> with Muslim Pro.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Ultimate Test of Ikhlas: Prophet Ibrahim&#8217;s Example</h2>



<p>The narrative that forms the foundation of Eid al-Adha and the act of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> is the story of Prophet Ibrahim AS, commanded by Allah in a dream to perform the ultimate sacrifice by offering his beloved son, Ismail AS. Imagine the weight of that command. It went against every fiber of human nature, against a father&#8217;s deepest love. Yet, Prophet Ibrahim AS prepared to obey. His conversation with Ismail AS, who also showed remarkable willingness to submit to the divine decree, is a testament to incredible faith.</p>



<p><a href="https://quran.com/37?startingVerse=102" data-type="link" data-id="https://quran.com/37?startingVerse=102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“When Ibrahim AS said to his son: ‘O my son, indeed I have seen in a dream that I [must] sacrifice you. So see what you think.’ Ismail replied, ‘O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, among the patient.’ (Quran 37:102)</a></p>



<p>This was the ultimate&nbsp; test of Ikhlas: To be willing to surrender what was most precious, to obey a command that seemed humanly impossible, purely out of love, trust, and surrender to Allah&#8217;s will. There was no worldly benefit to gain, no human validation to seek, only the absolute purity of intention to please the Creator. Allah&#8217;s intervention, replacing Ismail AS with a ram, proved that sincerity and willingness to obey were the ultimate measure of their Ikhlas, not the physical act of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> itself.</p>



<p>Connecting this incredible story to our lives today, our test of Ikhlas might not involve such a dramatic command, but it exists in many forms. It&#8217;s choosing to spend an hour helping a neighbor purely for Allah&#8217;s sake, even when you could be scrolling through social media. It&#8217;s donating to charity anonymously instead of seeking public recognition. It&#8217;s striving for excellence in your work because it is a trust from Allah, not just to impress your boss.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> sacrifice, by reminding us of Prophet Ibrahim&#8217;s ultimate sincerity, highlights that our willingness to sacrifice for Allah, whether wealth, time, or comfort, purely for His sake, is where true devotion lies.</p>



<p>Prophet Ibrahim AS and Ismail AS showed us the supreme test of Ikhlas through <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a>. This Eid, embody their pure submission in your own <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a>. Fulfill your <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> in the spirit of prophetic Ikhlas with Muslim Pro.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> as a Practical Exercise in Cultivating Ikhlas</h2>



<p>Beyond its historical roots, the practical performance of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> today offers several avenues for cultivating and testing our Ikhlas:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sacrificing Wealth:</strong> <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> requires spending lawful wealth to purchase the sacrificial animal. This is a direct test of our attachment to worldly possessions. Are we doing it to follow the crowd, or purely because Allah commanded it and we seek His pleasure? Are we overcome by stinginess, or do we give willingly and happily for His sake? This act trains us to detach from wealth and give purely for Allah.<br></li>



<li><strong>Performing the Act (or Arranging it):</strong> Ensuring the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> is done correctly, according to Sunnah and Islamic guidelines, is an act of obedience. When you meticulously arrange for the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> ritual, perhaps even unseen by many, your motivation must be pure obedience to Allah, not seeking human observation or praise for your efficiency. Doing it &#8216;behind the scenes&#8217; for Allah strengthens that inner sincerity.<br></li>



<li><strong>Distributing the Meat:</strong> Sharing the blessed meat with family, friends, and especially the needy, is a core part of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a>. Ikhlas are crucial here. Are we distributing seeking praise for our generosity, or solely to fulfill Allah&#8217;s command and bring joy and sustenance to others purely for His sake? The most sincere charity is often that which is given with no expectation of return or recognition from the recipient.</li>
</ol>



<p>Acknowledge these internal struggles against the whispers of Riya&#8217; (showing off) and the temptations of Nifaq (hypocrisy). <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> stands as a powerful annual practice for confronting these inner challenges and purifying our intentions for Allah&#8217;s sake.</p>



<p><em>“​​</em><em>Allah does not accept any deed, except that which is purely for Him, and seeking His Face. </em><em>”</em> (Sunan Nasai)</p>



<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> challenges us to overcome Riya&#8217; and perfect our Ikhlas in every step. This Eid, strive for pure intention in your sacrifice. Focus on what truly reaches Allah, and perform your heartfelt, Ikhlas-centered <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> easily and confidently with Muslim Pro.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ikhlas: The Key to an Accepted <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a></h2>



<p>Ultimately, Ikhlas is the fundamental condition for the acceptance of <em>any</em> act of worship in Islam. Allah does not accept deeds unless they are performed solely for His sake and according to the Sunnah of Rasulullah SAW. Performing <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> with Ikhlas is what transforms it from a mere tradition, a cultural practice, or a social obligation into a profoundly meaningful and accepted act of devotion in the sight of Allah.</p>



<p>As Allah clearly states in the <a href="https://quran.com/22?startingVerse=37" data-type="link" data-id="https://quran.com/22?startingVerse=37" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quran (22:37)</a>:</p>



<p>لَن يَنَالَ ٱللهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلَادِمَآؤُهَا وَلَـٰكِن يَنَالُهُ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ مِنكُمْۚ</p>



<p>&#8220;Their meat will not reach Allah, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is your piety (Taqwa).&#8221;</p>



<p>This powerful Ayah tells us that the physical components of the sacrifice are not what ascend to Allah; it is the Taqwa, the God-consciousness, the sincere intention (نِيَّة), and the purity of heart (Ikhlas) behind the act that truly matter and are accepted by Him. A <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> performed with sincere intention, even if humble, is infinitely more valuable in Allah&#8217;s sight than a grand sacrifice performed with pride or for show.</p>



<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> is a test of Ikhlas. Your sincere intention is key to acceptance. Perform your heartfelt sacrifice correctly and easily. Fulfill your accepted <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> with Muslim Pro today.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Carrying the Lesson of Ikhlas Beyond Eid</h2>



<p>The conscious effort to embody Ikhlas during <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> should not be limited to these blessed days. The annual practice becomes a powerful reminder to regularly check and purify our intentions in all other aspects of our lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is our prayer performed with full presence and sincerity for Allah alone?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is our fasting solely for His pleasure?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is our charity given without seeking thanks?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is our work done diligently because it is a trust from Him?</p>



<p>Let the spirit of seeking Ikhlas in the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> we perform inspire greater sincerity, focus on Allah, and purity of intention in every deed we do, big or small,&nbsp; you can perform your own <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> easily with Muslim Pro this year.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. What is </strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Badal Hajj</strong></a><strong>?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badal Hajj </a>refers to performing the pilgrimage on behalf of someone who is physically unable to do so themselves due to illness, old age, or death.</p>



<p>“A woman from the tribe of Khath’am said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, the obligation of Hajj has come upon my father while he is old and cannot sit firmly on his mount.’ The Prophet ﷺ said, ’Perform Hajj on behalf of your father.’” (Imam al-Bukhari)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Is</strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> Badal Hajj</strong></a><strong> Allowed in Islam?</strong></h2>



<p>Yes, it is not only allowed but encouraged when someone is permanently unable to perform Hajj.</p>



<p>“And Hajj to the House (Ka’bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, for those who are able to undertake the journey.” (Quran 3:97)</p>



<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badal Hajj</a> becomes an option when someone is no longer physically able to fulfill this obligation themselves.</p>



<p>With Muslim Pro’s <a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badal Hajj</a> service, you can ensure that the pilgrimage is completed properly on their behalf with full transparency and sincerity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Who Can Perform </strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Badal Hajj?</strong></a></h2>



<p>Only someone who has already completed their own obligatory Hajj can perform it on behalf of someone else.</p>



<p>A man said: “O Messenger of Allah, I want to perform Hajj on behalf of someone.”<br>He replied, “Have you performed Hajj for yourself?”<br>“No,” the man answered.<br>The Prophet ﷺ said, “Perform Hajj for yourself first, then for others.” (Sunan Abu Dawood, 1811)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Can I Perform Hajj on Behalf of a Deceased Person?</strong></h2>



<p>Absolutely. It’s one of the greatest gifts you can offer a loved one who has passed away.</p>



<p>Through Muslim Pro’s <a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badal Hajj,</a> your loved one’s pilgrimage can be performed in full accordance with Islamic rituals — and you’ll receive:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A personalized certificate of completion</li>



<li>Photo proof that the rites were performed</li>



<li>Peace of mind with a 100% refund policy if the pilgrimage cannot be completed for any reason</li>



<li>A free Badal Umrah as a fallback in rare circumstances</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Can </strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Badal Hajj</strong></a><strong> Be Done for Someone Who’s Alive?</strong></h2>



<p>Yes, but only if that person is <strong>permanently</strong> unable to travel due to illness or disability and their permission must be given beforehand.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Will the Deceased Receive the Full Reward?</strong></h2>



<p>Yes. The intention (niyyah) is made for them, and they receive the full reward of the pilgrimage.</p>



<p>By arranging <a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badal Hajj with Muslim Pro</a>, you not only fulfill a religious obligation on their behalf but also offer them a powerful act of sadaqah jariyah (ongoing charity) that continues to benefit them in the hereafter.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Can I Arrange </strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Badal Hajj </strong></a><strong>for Multiple People?</strong></h2>



<p>One pilgrim can only perform <a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badal Hajj </a>for one person per Hajj season. If you wish to do it for multiple individuals, each must be arranged with separate pilgrims and clear intentions.</p>



<p>Muslim Pro ensures that each <a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badal Hajj</a> is performed individually, sincerely, and with integrity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. What If the Pilgrimage Cannot Be Fulfilled?</strong></h2>



<p>While rare, unexpected events such as health emergencies or travel restrictions could prevent a Hajj from being completed.</p>



<p>If this ever happens, Muslim Pro offers a 100% refund, no questions asked. In addition, a Badal Umrah will be performed for free as an alternative, ensuring the spirit of the act is preserved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. How Do I Know It Was Completed?</strong></h2>



<p>Transparency and accountability are essential. That’s why Muslim Pro provides:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A certificate of completion</li>



<li>Photographic evidence from Makkah</li>



<li>Updates throughout the process</li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll have full peace of mind knowing your loved one’s Hajj is being honored with care and sincerity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. How Can I Get Started?</strong></h2>

</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Even if you can't afford a Qurban, your intentions, prayers, and acts of kindness still carry immense weight with Allah. Discover heartfelt ways to embrace the spirit of Eid al-Adha and earn its blessings.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to fulfil this <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-qurban/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.muslimpro.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-qurban/">beautiful act of Qurban</a>, let Muslim Pro help you carry out your <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> in a way that&#8217;s simple, meaningful, and deeply rewarding, both spiritually and for those in need. Fulfil your <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> with Muslim Pro this Eid. </p>



<p>Eid al-Adha is a sacred time when Muslims around the world come together in remembrance, gratitude, and sacrifice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for many, especially those facing financial hardship, the joy of performing <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> is something they simply can’t afford. If that’s you, know this: Allah sees your heart. And there are still beautiful, meaningful ways you can reap the immense rewards of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a>, even without offering an animal sacrifice.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Make Sincere Intention and Du’a</h2>



<p>It all begins with the heart. In Islam, your <strong>intentions (Niyyah)</strong> carry weight. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said:</p>



<p>“Actions are judged by intentions, and every person will be rewarded according to their intention.” <em>(Sahih Bukhari &amp; Muslim)</em></p>



<p>If your heart longs to <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/whats-the-difference-between-hady-and-qurban/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.muslimpro.com/whats-the-difference-between-hady-and-qurban/">perform Qurban </a>but your means are limited, don’t underestimate the power of sincere du’a. </p>



<p>Speak to Allah, tell Him your wish, and ask for the ability to do it in the future. Your desire alone, if genuine, holds value in the sight of Allah. Sometimes, a heartfelt intention is more beloved than a physical act.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Give to Charity</h2>



<p>At its core, <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> is an act of compassion, a way to feed the hungry and honor Allah through service to others. If you can’t afford a goat or cow, <strong>give what you can</strong> in other ways. Maybe it’s a warm meal for a neighbor, a small donation to a local charity, or sharing groceries with a struggling family.</p>



<p>Remember, even a date given with sincerity can weigh heavy on your scales of good deeds. Eid is a time of sharing, and you can still partake in that spirit, regardless of your financial situation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Assist Others in Performing <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Qurban</strong></a></h2>



<p>Maybe you can’t perform the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> yourself but you can still help facilitate it for others. Offer your time to help distribute meat, volunteer at a local masjid, or assist in organizing <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> logistics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These acts may seem small, but they carry immense reward.</p>



<p>By enabling others to fulfill their obligation, you become part of the good, and Allah rewards all those involved in facilitating khayr (goodness). It’s a reminder that even behind-the-scenes contributions are seen by Allah.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to fulfil this beautiful act of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a>, let Muslim Pro help you carry out your <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> in a way that&#8217;s simple, meaningful, and deeply rewarding, both spiritually and for those in need. Fulfil your <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> with Muslim Pro this Eid.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Sponsor or Donate to a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Qurban</strong></a> Program Online</h2>



<p>These days, many Muslim organizations offer global <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> campaigns that allow donors to sponsor animals in countries with greater need. Even if you can’t cover the full cost of a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a>, you can contribute a small amount toward a group effort.</p>



<p>Pooling resources with others allows you to share in the reward. You become part of something bigger, feeding families who otherwise wouldn’t enjoy meat this Eid. The beauty of Islam is that every small act done with sincerity is multiplied by Allah’s mercy.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to fulfil this beautiful act of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a>, let Muslim Pro help you carry out your <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> in a way that&#8217;s simple, meaningful, and deeply rewarding, both spiritually and for those in need. Fulfil your <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> with Muslim Pro this Eid.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Increase in Other Acts of Worship</h2>



<p>If you’re not able to give materially, increase in what you can give: your time, effort, and heart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The days leading up to Eid, especially the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah, are incredibly blessed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Prophet ﷺ said:</p>



<p>“There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days.” <em>(Imam Bukhari)</em></p>



<p>Pray extra. Fast if you can. Recite the Qur’an with Muslim Pro. Make dhikr abundantly. Fill your days with acts of worship and reflection. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> is one path to reward during Eid but it’s not the only one.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to fulfil this beautiful act of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a>, let Muslim Pro help you carry out your <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> in a way that&#8217;s simple, meaningful, and deeply rewarding, both spiritually and for those in need. Fulfil your <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> with Muslim Pro this Eid.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Stay Connected with the Spirit of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Qurban</strong></a></h2>



<p>Even if you can&#8217;t perform the act itself, you can live its essence: submission, gratitude, and sacrifice. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/Qurbanarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qurban</a> reminds us of Prophet Ibrahim&#8217;s devotion and trust in Allah, a man willing to sacrifice what he loved most for Allah SWT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ask yourself: What can I give up for Allah? Maybe it’s a bad habit, a grudge, or toxic resentments that you are still carrying with you. These internal sacrifices also draw you closer to Allah and are part of embodying the true spirit of Eid al-Adha.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Day of Arafah — the<a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/whats-so-special-about-the-first-10-days-of-zulhijjah/"> 9th day of Dhul Hijjah</a> — is one of the most sacred and spiritually charged days in Islam. It is the pinnacle of Hajj, where pilgrims gather on the plain of Arafah, seeking forgiveness and pouring their hearts out in dua. But even for those not performing Hajj, the blessings of this day are immense. If there’s one day not to miss in the Islamic calendar, it’s this.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Power of Arafah</strong></h2>



<p>The Prophet ﷺ said: “<em>There is no day on which Allah frees more people from the Fire than the Day of Arafah.</em>” (Imam Muslim)</p>



<p>This day is a divine opportunity, a time when the gates of mercy are flung open. Whether you’re making dua at home, at work, or between daily routines, Arafah is a day when Allah draws near and answers.</p>



<p>The Prophet ﷺ also said: <em>“The best of supplication is the supplication on the <a href="https://muslim.sg/articles/what-is-the-day-of-arafah" data-type="link" data-id="https://muslim.sg/articles/what-is-the-day-of-arafah" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Day of Arafah</a>, and the best of what I and the Prophets before me have said is: La ilaha illallah, wahdahu la sharika lah, lahul mulk wa lahul hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadir.”</em> (Imam At-Tirmidhi)</p>



<p>So, if you’ve been putting off making a heartfelt dua for healing, for rizq, for forgiveness, or clarity, this is the time. Don’t miss the window.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Even Without Hajj, You’re Not Left Out</strong></h2>



<p>You don’t need to be in Makkah to reap Arafah’s rewards. One of the greatest gifts of Islam is that our intentions matter. The Prophet ﷺ said:</p>



<p><em>“Actions are judged by intentions…”</em> (Imam Muslim)</p>



<p>Longing to be at Arafah? Allah sees that. Wishing to do more for your deen but held back by circumstances? Allah knows.</p>



<p><strong>There are deeds you can do outside of Hajj that carry Hajj-like rewards, including:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Praying Fajr in Congregation:</span></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Praying Fajr in congregation, then sitting in dhikr until sunrise, and following up with two rakaah is highly meritorious.</p>



<p>“Whoever prays Fajr in congregation, then sits remembering Allah until the sun rises, then prays two rakaahs, will have a reward like that of Hajj and Umrah — complete, complete, complete.” (Sunan al-Tirmidhi)<br></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fasting on Arafah Day:</span></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>“It expiates the sins of the past year and the coming year.” (Sahih Muslim)<br></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Giving Charity During Dhul Hijjah:</span></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>One of the most beloved deeds to Allah is giving charity during these blessed days.</p>



<p>“There are no days on which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days (the first ten days of <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/sunnah-acts-in-the-month-of-dhulhijjah/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.muslimpro.com/sunnah-acts-in-the-month-of-dhulhijjah/">Dhul-Hijjah</a>).” (Sahih al-Bukhari)</p>



<p>And one of the most powerful actions you can undertake on this day? <a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badal Hajj</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/BadalArticles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badal Hajj</a> embodies the spirit of sacrifice, intention, and compassion, offering you a meaningful alternative to the traditional pilgrimage, reminiscent of the devotion exhibited by the Prophet PBUH and his companions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Make Time for Dua And Be Specific</strong></h2>



<p>Here’s how to make the most of this sacred window:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Be Intentional:</strong> Ask Allah for both dunya and akhirah. Be raw. Be real.</li>



<li><strong>Use His Names:</strong> Invoke Al-Rahman, Al-Ghaffar, Al-Razzaq — let your heart call upon them.</li>



<li><strong>Make Dua for Others:</strong> Include prayers for your parents, friends, and even strangers who are suffering across the world.</li>



<li><strong>Believe in Acceptance:</strong> Allah promises to answer the desperate one who calls on Him (Qur’an 27:62).</li>
</ul>



<p>“Is He [not best] who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil…?” (Qur’an 27:62)</p>



<p>As you make dua, remember to combine it with purposeful action.</p>
