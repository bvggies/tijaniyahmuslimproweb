<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Al-Aqsa Mosque: A Sanctuary of Historical and Spiritual Significance</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/3277b9f1-4c4c-4642-a397-f2140839329d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a>, situated in the heart of <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/fe408823-21af-41f9-b4bc-3d1a2dfd0e30" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerusalem</a>, holds immense significance for Muslims around the world. Rich in history and deeply tied to spiritual significance, it has served as a place of worship for countless generations. Its importance isn&#8217;t just found in Islamic tradition but is also emphasized in the <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/c1c81a79-e7ee-49a7-974f-6335c4beb605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quran</a>, which highlights its blessed status and central role in the faith. For Muslims, Al-Aqsa is more than just a historical site—it&#8217;s a living symbol of their connection to faith and history.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Article-Thumbnail-Templates-WIP-1-1-1024x576.png" alt="Masjid Al-Aqsa" class="wp-image-11697" title="Significance of Masjid Al-Aqsa 4" srcset="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Article-Thumbnail-Templates-WIP-1-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Article-Thumbnail-Templates-WIP-1-1-600x338.png 600w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Article-Thumbnail-Templates-WIP-1-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Article-Thumbnail-Templates-WIP-1-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Article-Thumbnail-Templates-WIP-1-1.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Al-Quran</strong></h2>



<p>The sanctity of Al-Aqsa Mosque is highlighted in the Quran, particularly in Surah Al-Isra, verse 1, where Allah describes the miraculous Night Journey (Isra’) of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This verse glorifies Allah who took Prophet Muhammad ﷺ on a night journey from Al-Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem. The verse emphasizes the sacred nature of the mosque and its surrounding:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Glory be to the One Who took His servant ˹Muḥammad˺ by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque whose surroundings We have blessed, so that We may show him some of Our signs. Indeed, He alone is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.&#8221;</em> (Quran 17:1)</p>



<p>This verse not only marks the historical journey of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ but also highlights the divine blessings upon the area surrounding Al-Aqsa Mosque. It has been a place where many Prophets have walked and prayed, reinforcing its spiritual legacy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The First Qibla of Islam</strong></h2>



<p>Before the Kaaba in Makkah became the permanent Qibla for prayers, Al-Aqsa Mosque served as the first Qibla.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This important phase in the early development of Islam connects Muslims with Al-Aqsa making it a cherished part of their religious heritage. The shift of the Qibla from Al-Aqsa to the Kaaba came after divine instruction, but the connection between Muslims and this blessed sanctuary remains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Night of Isra’ and Al-Mi&#8217;raj</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DEEN-1024x576.jpg" alt="DEEN Significance of Masjid Al-Aqsa" class="wp-image-11867" title="Significance of Masjid Al-Aqsa 5" srcset="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DEEN-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DEEN-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DEEN-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DEEN-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DEEN.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/c6d9e25e-6a03-4459-8c03-041e8622e9f9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Night Journey (Al-Isra) and the Ascension (Al-Mi&#8217;raj</a>) are among the most extraordinary events in Islamic history. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was miraculously transported from Al-Masjid Al-Haram to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa, where he led the other Prophets in prayer. This was the peak of his prophetic journey, showing his role as a leader of all the Prophets.</p>



<p>After this prayer, the Prophet ﷺ ascended through the seven heavens, encountering various Prophets and witnessing divine wonders that are beyond human comprehension. Al-Aqsa thus became the gateway through which the Prophet ﷺ experienced the divine, making it a symbol of spiritual elevation and proximity to Allah.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Immense Rewards for Praying at Al-Aqsa</strong></h2>



<p>The virtues of Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa extend beyond its historical and spiritual significance. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ himself spoke of the unique rewards associated with praying in this blessed mosque. In a hadith narrated by Imam Baihaqi, the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;One prayer at Al-Masjid Al-Haram is better than a hundred thousand prayers in any other mosque, a thousand prayers at my mosque, and five hundred prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>This hadith highlights the magnified reward that believers can attain by offering prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque, making it a place of unique spiritual benefit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>One of the Holiest Sites in Islam</strong></h2>



<p>Today, Al-Aqsa Mosque stands as one of the three holiest sites in Islam, alongside Al-Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah and Al-Masjid An-Nabawi in Madinah. Each of these sites plays a vital role in the lives of Muslims, as they represent the physical manifestation of faith, worship, and connection with Allah.</p>



<p>Al-Aqsa continues to attract pilgrims from all over the world, despite the challenges and conflicts that surround it. For Muslims, visiting and praying at Al-Aqsa is not only an act of worship but also a way to honor the legacy of Prophets, including the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, and to reconnect with a cherished part of Islamic history.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Al-Aqsa Mosque is much more than a physical structure; it is a symbol of faith, unity, and spiritual elevation. Its significance lies in the Quranic revelation, the Prophetic traditions, and the deep history that resonates with Muslims across the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the trials and tribulations it has faced throughout history, <a href="https://www.muslimpro.com/difference-between-the-dome-of-the-rock-and-masjid-al-qibli/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.muslimpro.com/difference-between-the-dome-of-the-rock-and-masjid-al-qibli/">Al-Aqsa </a>remains a beacon of hope, peace, and devotion for the Muslim community. Through prayer and remembrance, the connection to this sacred sanctuary remains alive, inspiring future generations to hold fast to its legacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>KnowingHim ﷺ : He Loves Us</strong></h2>



<p>The love of <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/5f54bc3e-302a-4db4-9865-96d76e5a18fc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</a> for his Ummah is a profound and touching aspect of his character. His love for us went beyond time, extending even before our existence. This deep, unwavering love is evident in various aspects of his life and teachings.</p>



<p>One compelling story that exemplifies this love occurred during <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/3cdbe54c-41e3-42be-b820-29cb7623b76a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a significant moment in his life</a>. The Prophet <strong>ﷺ</strong> once stood before his companions, tears streaming down his face, as he spoke about his longing for his brothers. When asked by the companions who he was referring to, as they considered themselves his brothers, he replied,<em> “You are my companions, and our brothers are those who have, so far, not come into the world” </em>(Muslim). This statement highlights the deep emotional connection the Prophet <strong>ﷺ</strong> felt towards us, his future followers.</p>



<p>Moreover, the Prophet’s concern for his Ummah is reflected in his countless supplications. He frequently prayed for our well-being and guidance. One such prayer, as narrated by Imam Muslim, was for the forgiveness of his Ummah on the Day of Judgment. Even in his final moments, the Prophet <strong>ﷺ</strong> was heard murmuring, “Ummati, ummati” (My people, my people), showcasing his enduring love and concern.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Deepening Our Love for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</strong></h2>



<p>Understanding the profound love that Prophet Muhammad <strong>ﷺ</strong> had for us inspires us naturally to reciprocate that affection. Here are some actions we can take to deepen our love for him:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Learn about His Life and Teachings:&nbsp;</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Engaging with the Seerah, the biography of the Prophet Muhammad <strong>ﷺ</strong>, brings us closer to him by offering a profound understanding of <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/3cdbe54c-41e3-42be-b820-29cb7623b76a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his life</a>, sacrifices, character, and the immense wisdom he imparted. This engagement not only enriches our knowledge but also helps us appreciate <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/b601c38f-d685-477d-9542-bc4df829f7d1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the challenges he faced</a> and the virtues he exemplified. </p>



<p>By immersing ourselves in <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/3cdbe54c-41e3-42be-b820-29cb7623b76a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his life’s details</a>, we gain valuable insights that inspire us to integrate his teachings into our own lives, thereby fostering a stronger spiritual connection with him and aligning our actions with his noble example.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Emulate His Character:&nbsp;</h3>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>The Prophet <strong>ﷺ</strong> is described as “an excellent example”. Allah mentioned in Surah Al-Ahzab verse 21:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="290" src="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png" alt="image 1 The Love Prophet Muhammad PBUH Had For His Ummah" class="wp-image-10367" title="The Love Prophet Muhammad PBUH Had For His Ummah 6" srcset="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-600x109.png 600w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-300x54.png 300w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-1024x186.png 1024w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-768x139.png 768w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-1536x278.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>Which means:<em> Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often.</em></p>



<p>When we make an effort to embody the Prophet’s traits of kindness, patience, honesty, and humility in our daily lives, we cultivate a more profound and meaningful connection with him. This conscious practice not only honors his exemplary character but also allows us to mirror the essence of his noble qualities in our own behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By integrating these traits into our interactions and decisions, we create a tangible reflection of his teachings within our hearts, fostering a deeper spiritual bond. This ongoing commitment to uphold his virtues enriches our personal growth and strengthens our relationship with him, helping us to live out the values he espoused and enhancing our overall sense of devotion and alignment with <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/3cdbe54c-41e3-42be-b820-29cb7623b76a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his life’s example</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Increasing Our salutations upon him:&nbsp;</h3>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Sending blessings upon the Prophet <strong>ﷺ</strong> (Salawat) is a powerful way to express our love and admiration. The Quran instructs us in Surah Al-Ahzab, verse 56:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="290" src="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png" alt="image The Love Prophet Muhammad PBUH Had For His Ummah" class="wp-image-10366" title="The Love Prophet Muhammad PBUH Had For His Ummah 7" srcset="https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png 1600w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-600x109.png 600w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-300x54.png 300w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1024x186.png 1024w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-768x139.png 768w, https://www.muslimpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1536x278.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>Which means: Indeed, <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/4523b6cf-91c4-4db0-b42d-360185c43952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allah showers His blessings upon the Prophet</a>, and His angels pray for him. O&nbsp; believers! Invoke Allah’s blessings upon him, and salute him with worthy greetings of peace.</p>



<p>Regularly reciting phrases like “Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa ala aali Muhammad” can significantly increase our spiritual connection with him.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Follow His Sunnah in speech and actions:&nbsp;</h3>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Incorporating the actions and practices of the <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/4523b6cf-91c4-4db0-b42d-360185c43952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</a> into our daily routines is a profound way to honor his legacy and bring his teachings to life. This approach extends beyond formal acts of worship, such as prayer and fasting, to include everyday behaviors that reflect his character and values. </p>



<p>By adopting his practices in areas like proper eating manners, courteous greetings, and even how we sleep, we align our daily lives with his example. These seemingly small actions, when performed with intention, embody the spirit of his teachings and serve as a continual reminder of his guidance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Embracing these practices not only pays tribute to his legacy but also transforms our daily interactions into opportunities for personal growth and spiritual connection, making his example a living part of our lives.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Teach and Encourage Others to send peace and blessings upon him:&nbsp;</h3>



<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Sharing the importance of Selawat with friends and family and encouraging them to make it a regular practice can deeply enrich their spiritual lives and foster a stronger connection with the Prophet Muhammad <strong>ﷺ</strong>. By regularly invoking blessings upon him, individuals not only express their love and reverence but also invite the Prophet’s <strong>ﷺ</strong> intercession on the Day of Judgment, which can provide immense spiritual benefit. </p>



<p>The love that Prophet Muhammad <strong>ﷺ</strong> had for his Ummah is a testament to his unparalleled compassion and mercy. <a href="https://app.muslimpro.com/qalbox/search/details/3cdbe54c-41e3-42be-b820-29cb7623b76a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">By learning about his life</a>, emulating his character, increasing our Selawat, and teaching others about him, we can deepen our love and connection with him. Let us strive to honor his legacy and keep his memory alive in our hearts and actions. May Allah grant us the ability to love and follow the Prophet <strong>ﷺ</strong> as he deserves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the quiet moments of reflection, we often&nbsp;<a href="https://connect.muslimpro.com/2024/03/how-to-deepen-your-connection-with-the-quran/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn to the Quran</a>&nbsp;for guidance, comfort, and a deeper connection with our Creator. Imagine, for a moment, being unable to read these sacred words due to a visual impairment. The words that have brought solace to countless souls remain out of reach, not because of a lack of faith, but due to the absence of accessibility. For millions of visually impaired Muslims around the world, this is a daily reality—a reality that often leaves them feeling isolated from their community and disconnected from the spiritual nourishment that the Quran provides.</p>



<p>At Muslim Pro, we believe that every Muslim, regardless of their physical abilities, deserves the chance to engage with the Quran. This belief drives our commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, not just through the tools we offer but also through the stories we tell. On Qalbox,&nbsp;<a href="http://qalbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our streaming platform</a>, we’ve curated a collection of titles that highlight the experiences of visually impaired Muslims, the importance of accessibility, and the universal message of Islam that transcends all barriers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7 Qalbox Films on Blindness and Faith</strong></h3>



<p>These must-watch films and documentaries are more than just educational — they’re a powerful reminder of our shared responsibility to support and uplift every member of our ummah. Whether you’re seeking inspiration, knowledge, or simply a deeper understanding of how our faith embraces all individuals, these titles offer something for everyone.</p>
