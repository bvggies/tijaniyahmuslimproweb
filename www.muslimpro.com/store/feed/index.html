					<description><![CDATA[Displaced by conflict, many Palestinian refugees enter winter with limited access to food supplies. Each hamper provides a month’s supply of nourishing essentials for one person to get through the cold season.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many Palestinian refugees, even securing a single daily meal can be a challenge — especially during winter, when work and resources are harder to come by. Displacement has left individuals with limited access to food and basic supplies.</p>
<p>Each Food &#038; Cooking Essentials Hamper provides one person with nourishing staples to sustain them for a month. The package includes rice, lentils, beans, pasta, tomato purée, oil, powdered milk, tea, canned sardines, and more — ensuring they have what’s needed to prepare warm meals and find steadiness amid hardship.</p>
<p>This winter, every hamper delivered helps fill empty shelves and bring comfort to those far from home.</p>
